### Project Overview:
This project focuses on using deep learning techniques to classify electrocardiogram (ECG) images for the diagnosis of cardiovascular diseases. The dataset comprises ECG images belonging to four distinct classes:

1. **ECG Images of Myocardial Infarction Patients**
2. **ECG Images of Patients with abnormal heartbeat**
3. **ECG Images of Patients with a history of MI**
4. **Normal Person ECG Images**

### Preprocessing:
Before training the models, we performed preprocessing steps to enhance the quality of the ECG images. These steps included cropping to remove irrelevant edges and removing gridlines for better clarity. While normalization was considered, it wasn't included in this particular implementation.

### Model Implementation:
We employed state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models, specifically:
- **VGG16**
- **Xception**
- **DenseNet**

These models were trained on the preprocessed ECG image dataset to learn discriminative features that could aid in classification.

### Feature Matrix Extraction:
From the trained CNN models, we extracted feature matrices. These matrices encapsulate the salient features of the ECG images, which are crucial for subsequent classification tasks.

### Classifier Implementation:
Using the extracted feature matrices, we implemented various classifiers, including:
- **Perceptron**
- **Naive Bayes**
- **(Mention other classifiers used)**

These classifiers were trained on the feature matrices to learn the underlying patterns and relationships in the data.

### Evaluation and Results:
We thoroughly evaluated the performance of each classifier using standard metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Through rigorous experimentation, we gained insights into the efficacy of different classifiers for ECG image classification.

### Conclusion:
In conclusion, this project underscores the potential of deep learning approaches in the diagnosis of cardiovascular diseases using ECG images. The findings shed light on the suitability of various classifiers and pave the way for further research in this domain.
